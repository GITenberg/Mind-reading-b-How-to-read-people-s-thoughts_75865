</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many pages have been, and probably, will be,
devoted to lengthy essays on the art, science, and
theory of so called mind reading.</p>

<p>To the average reader such an essay is dull and
uninteresting as well as uninstructive, and of no
practical use.</p>

<p>Rare instances of genuine thought transference
there may be, they are not general, and not possible
to even the most susceptible people in a promiscuous
and usually unsympathetic audience.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> here given is the method
used by Stuart Cumberland, the late Washington
Bishop and others who might be termed professional
mind readers.</p>

<p>This system is known as “muscle reading” and
ethereal influence, thought waves, and other uncertain
and generally unreliable things form no
part of the programme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<p>The usual feats of the mind reader who gives
public exhibitions are to find concealed articles,
write names, pick out keys thought of on piano
or similar instrument.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">How To Find a Hidden Pin.</h2>
</div>


<p>Request that some one produce an ordinary pin.</p>

<p>Allow yourself to be blindfolded and accompanied
to a separate room by some person in the audience,
in whom spectators place confidence.
While you are thus voluntarily exiled, one person
in the auditorium (whether it be parlor or theater)
is to fix his mind upon some place, then slowly
walk there and hide the pin. He then returns to
his seat. The others who are present, of course
know where the article is.</p>

<p>You are now taken into the auditorium. The
person who hid the pin is requested to come and
take your hand, you being blindfolded. Ask him
to fix his right hand flatly upon yours, facing in
the same direction, <i lang="la">i. e.</i>, his fingers are placed
against yours. You now place your hand upon the
back of his, thus holding his hand in a sort of vice.
In order to hold his hand as above described, it
will be necessary for him to remain close to your
side, yet he should not otherwise come in contact
with you. Now tell him to fix his mind intently
upon the spot where the pin is hidden, and that<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
you will lead him to the locality. The secret of
doing this seemingly supernatural feat is as
follows:</p>

<p>Relax your vice-like position of hands, so that
if he desired he could pull his hand away without
much friction. Now, although you have not the
remotest knowledge (and you should not have any
idea) as to where the pin is hidden, start off suddenly
in some direction and request that he follow
you, but go so fast at first that you will pull away
from his hand. By practice <em>you will learn that if
you have started in the proper direction, he will
willingly accompany you, if you have started in
another direction, he will unconsciously hold
back</em>. His resistance will be very slight, almost
unperceptible, except to a practiced operator.
Let us suppose that you have found that you are
going in the right direction, move along fast.
When it is time to turn, his mind being intently
fixed upon the place he wants to go to, will unconsciously,
but very naturally, control his muscles,
so that he will at once show a slight resistance,
and if you take immediate action upon this “hint”
and turn, he will either “favor” you or show
more resistance, according to whether you turn
in correct or incorrect direction. When you have
approached near to the spot, there will be more
resistance or freedom in accompanying you.<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
Then your fine work begins. Change the position
of hands so that his forms the vice while your right
hand is the one between. Your left hand is now
extended as a “feeler.” Request that while he attentively
watches your left hand, he also keep his
mind more intently than ever upon the location
of the object. Raise your left hand up, at the
same time raising your right hand slightly upward.
If his thoughts are upon a place that is
above the usual level of your hands, he will willingly
raise his hands (which are on your right hand
flatly,) or if the article is hidden low, he will resist,
but favor your hands when you begin to move
them downward. Thus you can closely locate the
article.</p>

<p>If you are not blindfolded tightly, you can quite
easily see what is below your nose, and this may
enable you to catch sight of the pin and pick it up
more readily, otherwise follow your “cues.”</p>

<p>A well known gentleman who is now a professional
mind reader once paid one hundred dollars
for the foregoing.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">The Whole Secret.</h2></div>


<p>The whole secret is in the fact that if a person
is intently thinking of some object in a certain
place, his head will generally unconsciously lean
toward the spot in question. If he is walking<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
with a mind reader, who declares that he is about
to go to the certain spot, the person will involuntarily
aid him in doing so, as has been indicated.
Some performers do not adopt the first position of
hands, and then change them when probably near
the object, as described, but instead, use the last
named position entirely, thus leaving the left hand
of the operator free at all times.</p>

<p>The secret of picking out certain notes or keys
on a piano is similar. In this case move your left
hand quickly from one end to the other, at the
same time moving your right hand. Your accompanist
will involuntarily hesitate somewhere, then
you may stop and move your left hand over a very
limited space until you finally settle upon the exact
spot.</p>

<p>To write a name thought of, is the most difficult
of all. This is done on a large blackboard. With
chalk in your left hand, mark out lines in shape
of letters. The person whose thought you are
reading will assist you without knowing he is doing
so.</p>

<p>Other feats are done on the same principle.</p>

<p>If the person whom you are operating with, does
not keep his mind intently upon what you require
you will not be as likely to succeed. If you fail,
you can ascribe this as the reason. The late Foster,
a celebrated “spiritualist” used to tell names<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
by picking out letters on children’s toy alphabet
blocks. This he did in a similar way to that
described for finding certain keys on a piano.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">Choose Your “Subject.”</h2></div>


<p>Pick out your “subject” or person whom you
will operate with carefully. Avoid those of the
extremely skeptical or “know it all” kind. Do not
try to do much with women, unless they are aged
and believe you to be a medium; in fact those who
believe in you will be your best assistants. Do
not select as an accompanist, a person who is
about your own age; such a person is usually jealous,
and does not want you to succeed. Avoid
lawyers and doctors as assistants; they are recognized
as being more adept in all things than the
balance of mankind, therefore they will oppose
you on general principles. The best “subjects”
are clergymen, aged people and believers in spiritualism.
Although most mind readers allow pins
to be hidden, a knife, or pocket book will do quite
as well and is easier to locate when near.</p>

<p>Before trying anything of this sort in public,
practice well. Remember that you cannot acquire
all in a day.</p>

<p>This is the full secret of mind reading as it is
practiced in the parlors or on the stage by people
who make it their business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>By careful practice at home you can after a few
weeks become an expert if you wish.</p>

<p>It doesn’t require a professional mind reader to
discover that a man thinks more of a beautiful
well formed woman, than he does of a woman
with a “muddy” skin or flat chest.</p>

<p>Women who wish to become beautiful, or men
who wish to see their wives and sweethearts beautiful
should write to Mrs. Helen Marko, Box 3032,
N. Y. City, for her private circular regarding bust
development, and fair complexion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Human Hair in Warships.</h2></div>


<p>A fact that has recently come to light shows a<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
new use to which human hair has been put. During
the last year or two tons of hair have been
packed between the plates of a certain part of war
vessels. Hair is very elastic, and thus affords a
most effective backing to metal. Again, it is being
used very satisfactorily to form a kind of
fender, which is thrown over the side of a vessel
to prevent her scraping against the dock—to take
the place, in fact, of more commonly used rope
coils.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">His Glasses Stolen Off His Nose.</h2></div>


<p>He is a well-known figure in Chicago, particularly
among the old settlers. It was 4 o’clock and
the daily afternoon stream of homegoers had set
in. He had made his uneventful way from his
editorial sanctum, as he does, with few exceptions,
every day in the year, to the stairs on Congress
street, which lead to the trains on the Alley
L road. As is his wont, he was pursuing a wholly
subjective train of thought as he jostled along<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
with the tide of humanity which was moving up
the stairs to board a train.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as he was reaching the landing,
his gold-bowed spectacles were swept off his nose
and he found himself dazed and blinking, too
much astonished for the moment to cry out, and
quite unable to see anything distinctly. As soon
as he fairly realized what had happened he cried
out:</p>

<p>“I’ve been robbed! Officer! Where is an officer?”
While the usual stampede which invariably
attends excitement of any sort in a crowd was
going on the train moved off, and the officer put
in an appearance. By this time the editor, full of
years and experience, who had of a truth had his
property stolen before his very eyes, had reflected
that probably his spectacles were already in a
pawn shop, and also that he did not care to see
his name in print in connection with the incident.
He, therefore, coolly stated to the officer that he
had been the victim of a practical joke, and made
his way home as best he could, not being able to
see anything distinctly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Took the Prescription.</h2></div>


<p>A bachelor had the blues, and applied to a doctor
for some medicine. The doctor inquired into
his case, and wrote a prescription in Latin, which
the bachelor took to a drug store. Translated,
the prescription read:</p>

<p>“Seventeen yards of silk, with a woman in it.”</p>

<p>After the druggist got through laughing, the
bachelor proposed to a lady that evening, and was

<p>Some careful experiments which have been

is about 500,000 “train miles.” In other words,
that a locomotive of the latest improved pattern
will run 500,000 miles before wearing out so as to
be useless. In making this run of 500,000 miles,
the fire box will have to be renewed three times,
the wheel tires five or six times and the crank
axles from three to five times.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Couldn’t Bluff Her.</h2></div>


<p>I was at the railroad offices to see the manager,
and while I waited for him a little, old woman in
a poke bonnet and a homespun dress and carrying
a long used umbrella in her hand, came upstairs<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
and, after looking around she walked up to me
and said:</p>

<p>“Waitin’ to see the boss, I reckon?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So’m I. Ever see him befo’?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I hev. He’s a bluffer. He’ll jest try to
out-holler yo’. If he can’t do that he will sulk like
a mewl. If yo’ don’t seem to kear fur that then
he’ll order yo’ out. Then’s the time you want to
draw back yo’r umbrella, like this, and pint it at
him, like this, and let him see he’s got to cum
down or you’ll make a hole right threw him. Bin
run over by the railroad?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Had hogs or cattle run over?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Wall, keep an eye on him in thar’, and don’t
take no bluff.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later I met her downstairs. She
had several greenbacks in her hand, and seemed
to be in a pleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>“Did you succeed?” I queried.</p>

<p>“Yo’ jest shout that I did!” she replied, shaking
the money at me. “Went in thar’ and crooked my
finger at him and sez:</p>

<p>“Cum down! Yo’r ole railroad has smashed
him all to squash and has to pay fer it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>“‘How much?’ sez he.</p>

<p>“‘Twenty dollars,’ sez I.</p>

<p>“‘Make it fifteen, or I punch!’</p>

<p>“‘Wal, say fifteen.’”</p>

<p>“And so you had a hog run over and got $15 for
it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Hawg? Hawg? Who said hawg!” she demanded.
“No, sah! The railroad ran over my ole man and
scattered him along fur seven miles and I do believe
if I’d struck for $16 I’d hev got it plump
down in my hand!”</p>
